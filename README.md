â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ java/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Main.java          # Main entry point with example code
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                     # Git ignore file for Java projects
â””â”€â”€ README.md                      # This file
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any text editor or IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)

### Running the Program

1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac src/main/java/Main.java -d .
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

### Expected Output
```
Welcome to ADS Assignment Starter!
This is a basic Java project template.
You can modify this file to implement your assignment requirements.

--- Basic Algorithm Example ---
Original array: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3]
Maximum value: 9
Sum of all elements: 28
```

## What's Included

The `Main.java` file contains:
- A basic main method with welcome message
- Example array processing algorithms:
  - Finding maximum value in an array
  - Calculating sum of array elements
  - Array printing utility
- Proper JavaDoc documentation
- Error handling examples

## How to Use This Starter

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Modify** the `Main.java` file to implement your assignment requirements
3. **Add additional classes** in the `src/main/java/` directory as needed
4. **Compile and test** your code regularly
5. **Document your code** following the existing JavaDoc style

## Tips for ADS Assignments

- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add proper JavaDoc comments for all public methods
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Test your algorithms with different input sizes
- Consider time and space complexity in your implementations

## Common Data Structures to Implement

- Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary, BST, AVL, etc.)
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Heaps

## Common Algorithms to Implement

- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
